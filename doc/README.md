# Documentation

This `doc` folder is the future location of documentation for Subiquity.   This
will be used to migrate the official documentation to readthedocs, and later
will be the home of that documentation.

The `../documentation` folder is the existing location for this sort of
documentation.  As the RTD version is not yet ready, documentation changes
should be made to `../documentation` until this README is updated to say
otherwise.  As such, please make any desired documentation changes to
`../documentation`.
