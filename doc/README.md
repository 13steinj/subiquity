# Documentation

This `doc` folder is the location of documentation for Subiquity.

In the not distant past, there was also a `../documentation` folder, but that
is now an obsolete copy of what was on Discourse.

# Local preview

To build this documentation, you can run `make install` from this folder to
create the virtual environment.

Then run the `make run` command, which will build a html version of the docs,
and serve the docs in the virtual environment. This is very convenient if you
are working on them and want your saved changes to be reflected as a working
preview.
