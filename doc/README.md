# Documentation

This temporary folder (`../doc/`) is subject to change and only exists to help
migrate the official documentation for this project to readthedocs.com.

The `../documentation/` folder is the working location for our docs. Any changes
you would like to add to the documentation should be made from this directory,
and not from `../doc/`.
